# Number-Writing-Manipulator-implemented-using-ROS-and-Gazebo-
A Number Writing Manipulator that is implemented using ROS2 Humble and runs on the Gazebo Simulation Platform


The goal of this project is to design and implement a spatial robotic manipulator capable of writing the characters {1,3,4,5,9,0} on a given surface. 
The manipulator should have a suitable degree of freedom to accurately reproduce the desired characters based on the input.

A manipulator is a mechanism made of at least two links and a end effector to enable it to interact with the physical environment is a useful manner. 
Degree Of Freedom (DOF) is the number of independent variables that define the possible positions or motions of a mechanical system in space. 
For this project, a manipulator with 3 DOF is sufficient and the same has been implemented.
